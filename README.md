# VideoGame_DataAnalysis

## Technologies Used
**Python**, **PySpark**, **Power BI**

## Overview
Performed end-to-end data wrangling and exploratory analysis on large-scale video game datasets using Apache Spark to uncover trends in game popularity, platform distribution, developer patterns, and user engagement metrics.

## Key Contributions

- Cleaned, transformed, and joined multi-source data (games, genres, developers, scores) into a unified, high-quality DataFrame.
- Computed **weighted average scores**, removed outliers and duplicates, and applied advanced filtering and aggregation operations.
- Performed **pivot and unpivot transformations** to analyze genre–platform relationships and developer–genre publishing patterns.
- Measured **execution time** to evaluate PySpark transformation performance.
- Exported the processed dataset for visualization.
- Built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** highlighting:
  - Most-played and most-wishlisted games
  - Game distribution by platform and developer
  - Genre preferences and developer diversity

## Outcome
The final project provided data-driven insights for stakeholders in the gaming industry using scalable big data tools and dynamic visual analytics.
